## Overview

- RemeMo is an improved T5-based language model, which gains advanced reasoning abilities over complex temporal dependencies through pre-training using a novel time-relation-prediction (TRC) objective.

- RemeMo is recommended to be used as a replacement of T5 (or other seq2seq models) in downstream tasks that require complex temporal reasoning, e.g., temporal question answering.

## Environment Setup

```
conda create -n rememo python=3.8
conda activate rememo

git clone https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/RemeMo.git
cd RemeMo
pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Fine-tune

1. Customize the configurations in `src/odqa_t5/run_finetuning.sh` ;
2. Run 
    ```
    mkdir src/odqa_t5/log
    sh src/odqa_t5/run_finetuning.sh
    ```

### Time-identification

1. To run inference:
    
    see `src/time_expression/inference_time_identification.sh` .
    
2. To train a new model:
    
    see `src/time_expression/train_time_identification_model.sh` .
    

### Pre-train

1. Customize  the configurations in `src/pretran_t5/run_pretrain.sh` :
    - `NSP_MODE`: choices include $\{$`mlm` (T5+LM), `mlm_trelation` (RemeMo)$\}$.
    - See `data/pretrain` for examples of the pre-training data. Prepare your own pre-training data following the same format.
    - Modify other arguments if needed.
2. Run
    ```
    mkdir src/pretrain_t5/log
    sh src/pretrain_t5/run_pretrain.sh
    ```
