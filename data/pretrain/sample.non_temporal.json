Bouton of Harvard University, who also developed the complete theory of the game in 1901, but the origins of the name were never fully explained.", "Nim is typically played as a \"mis\u00e8re game\", in which the player to take the last object loses. Nim can also be played as a \"normal play\" game whereby the player taking the last object wins. This is called normal play because the last move is a winning move in most games, even though it is not the normal way that Nim is played. In either normal play or a mis\u00e8re game, when the number of heaps with at least two objects is exactly equal to one, the player who takes next can easily win. If this removes either all or all but one objects from the heap that has two or more, then no heaps will have more than one object, so the players are forced to alternate removing exactly one object until the game ends. If the player leaves an even number of non-zero heaps (as the player would do in normal play), the player takes last; if the player leaves an odd number of heaps (as the player would do in mis\u00e8re play), then the other player takes last.", "Normal play Nim (or more precisely the system of nimbers) is fundamental to the Sprague\u2013Grundy theorem, which essentially says that in normal play every impartial game is equivalent to a Nim heap that yields the same outcome when played in parallel with other normal play impartial games (see disjunctive sum).", "While all normal play impartial games can be assigned a Nim value, that is not the case under the mis\u00e8re convention.

This operation is also known as \"bitwise xor\" or \"vector addition over GF(2)\" (bitwise addition modulo 2). Within combinatorial game theory it is usually called the nim-sum, as it will be called here. The nim-sum of \"x\" and \"y\" is written to distinguish it from the ordinary sum, .

To find out which move to make, let X be the nim-sum of all the heap sizes. Find a heap where the nim-sum of X and heap-size is less than the heap-size; the winning strategy is to play in such a heap, reducing that heap to the nim-sum of its original size with X.

After that, no matter what move your opponent makes, you can make the same move on the other heap, guaranteeing that you take the last object.", "When played as a mis\u00e8re game, Nim strategy is different only when the normal play move would leave only heaps of size one. In that case, the correct move is to leave an odd number of heaps of size one (in normal play, the correct move would be to leave an even number of such heaps).", "These strategies for normal play and a mis\u00e8re game are the same until the number of heaps with at least two objects is exactly equal to one. At that point, the next player removes either all objects (or all but one) from the heap that has two or more, so no heaps will have more than one object (in other words, so all remaining heaps have exactly one object each), so the players are forced to alternate removing exactly one object until the game ends.

The number of elements that may be removed from each heap may be either arbitrary or limited to at most \"r\" elements, like in the \"subtraction game\" above.", "The winning strategy is as follows: Like in ordinary multi-heap Nim, one considers the binary representation of the heap sizes (or heap sizes modulo \"r\"\u00a0+\u00a01). In ordinary Nim one forms the XOR-sum (or sum modulo 2) of each binary digit, and the winning strategy is to make each XOR sum zero. In the generalization to index-\"k\" Nim, one forms the sum of each binary digit modulo \"k\"\u00a0+\u00a01.", "Again the winning strategy is to move such that this sum is zero for every digit. Indeed, the value thus computed is zero for the final position, and given a configuration of heaps for which this value is zero, any change of at most \"k\" heaps will make the value non-zero.

In 1632, he was exiled from France after a duel. When Ninon's mother, Marie Barbe , died ten years later, the unmarried Ninon entered a convent, only to leave the next year. For the remainder of her life she was determined to remain unmarried and independent.", "Returning to Paris, she became a popular figure in the salons, and her own drawing room became a centre for the discussion and consumption of the literary arts. In her early thirties she was responsible for encouraging the young Moli\u00e8re, and when she died she left money for the son of her notary, a nine-year-old named Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet, later to become known as Voltaire, so he could buy books.", "It was during this period that her life as a courtesan began. Ninon took a succession of notable and wealthy lovers, including the king's cousin the Great Cond\u00e9, Gaston de Coligny, and Fran\u00e7ois, duc de La Rochefoucauld. These men did not support her, however; she prided herself on her independent income. \"Ninon always had crowds of adorers but never more than one lover at a time, and when she tired of the present occupier, she said so frankly and took another. Yet such was the authority of this wanton, that no man dared fall out with his successful rival; he was only too happy to be allowed to visit as a familiar friend,\" Saint-Simon wrote. In 1652, Ninon took up with Louis de Mornay, the marquis de Villarceaux, by whom she had a son, also named Louis. She lived with the marquis until 1655, when she returned to Paris. When she would not return to him, the marquis fell into a fever; to console him, Ninon cut her hair and sent the shorn locks to him, starting a vogue for bobbed hair \"\u00e0 la Ninon\".", "This life (less acceptable in her time than it would become in later years) and her opinions on organised religion caused her some trouble, and she was imprisoned in the Madelonnettes Convent in 1656 at the behest of Anne of Austria, Queen of France and regent for her son Louis XIV. Not long after, however, she was visited by Christina, former queen of Sweden. Impressed, Christina wrote to Cardinal Mazarin on Ninon's behalf and arranged for her release.", "In response, as an author she defended the possibility of living a good life in the absence of religion, notably in 1659's \"La coquette veng\u00e9e\" (\"The Flirt Avenged\").

Later she would become a close friend with the devout Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, better known as Madame de Maintenon, the lady-in-waiting who would later become the second wife of Louis XIV. Saint-Simon wrote that \"The lady did not like her to be mentioned in her presence, but dared not disown her, and wrote cordial letters to her from time to time, to the day of her death\". Ninon eventually died at the age of 84, as a very wealthy woman. To the end, she \"was convinced that she had no soul, and never abandoned that conviction, not even in advanced old age, not even at the hour of her death.\"", "Ninon de l'Enclos is a relatively obscure figure in the English-speaking world, but is much better known in France where her name is synonymous with wit and beauty.

NIST also established a research and development program to provide the technical basis for improved building and fire codes, standards, and practices, and a dissemination and technical assistance program to engage leaders of the construction and building community in implementing proposed changes to practices, standards, and codes. NIST also is providing practical guidance and tools to better prepare facility owners, contractors, architects, engineers, emergency responders, and regulatory authorities to respond to future disasters. The investigation portion of the response plan was completed with the release of the final report on 7 World Trade Center on November 20, 2008.

All four were recognized for their work related to laser cooling of atoms, which is directly related to the development and advancement of the atomic clock. In 2011, Dan Shechtman was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on quasicrystals in the Metallurgy Division from 1982 to 1984.

Fifteen individuals have officially held the position (in addition to four acting directors who have served on a temporary basis).", "The NIST holds patents on behalf of the Federal government of the United States, with at least one of them being custodial to protect public domain use, such as one for a Chip-scale atomic clock, developed by a NIST team as part of a DARPA competition.", "In September 2013, both \"The Guardian\" and \"The New York Times\" reported that NIST allowed the National Security Agency (NSA) to insert a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator called Dual EC DRBG into NIST standard SP 800-90 that had a kleptographic backdoor that the NSA can use to covertly predict the future outputs of this pseudorandom number generator thereby allowing the surreptitious decryption of data. Both papers report that the NSA worked covertly to get its own version of SP 800-90 approved for worldwide use in 2006. The whistle-blowing document states that \"eventually, NSA became the sole editor\". The reports confirm suspicions and technical grounds publicly raised by cryptographers in 2007 that the EC-DRBG could contain a kleptographic backdoor (perhaps placed in the standard by NSA).", "NIST responded to the allegations, stating that \"NIST works to publish the strongest cryptographic standards possible\" and that it uses \"a transparent, public process to rigorously vet our recommended standards\". The agency stated that \"there has been some confusion about the standards development process and the role of different organizations in it...The National Security Agency (NSA) participates in the NIST cryptography process because of its recognized expertise. NIST is also required by statute to consult with the NSA.\" Recognizing the concerns expressed, the agency reopened the public comment period for the SP800-90 publications, promising that \"if vulnerabilities are found in these or any other NIST standards, we will work with the cryptographic community to address them as quickly as possible\u201d. Due to public concern of this cryptovirology attack, NIST rescinded the EC-DRBG algorithm from the NIST SP 800-90 standard."]}

This distinction is not made for helicopters.", "Before the 1980s, reporting names for submarines were taken from the NATO spelling alphabet. Modifications of existing designs were given descriptive terms, such as \"Whiskey Long Bin\". From the 1980s, new designs were given names derived from Russian words, such as \"Akula\", or \"shark\". These names did not correspond to the Soviet names. Coincidentally, \"Akula\", which was assigned to an attack submarine by NATO, was the actual Soviet name for the ballistic missile submarine NATO named \"Typhoon-class\". The NATO names for submarines of the People's Republic of China are taken from Chinese dynasties."]}
